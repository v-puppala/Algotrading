# Algotrading
This is a support-vector machine based algotrading model which trains on a OHLCV dataset.

**3 Month SVC Classifier**

Initially, I trained the support vector machine on the 3 month period from April 2nd 2015 to July 2nd 2015. 
The decisions predicted from the classifier trained on this historical 3 month window were used to obtain predicted returns, which were then graphed alongside actual returns.
